<h2>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h2>

<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>

<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR.

<h3>TestFlight</h3>

    <li>Name (entered by developer, if developer invited user to Testflight)</li>
    <li>Invitation Type (whether user was invited via email or through a public link)</li>
    <li>Installs (the number of times you have installed a beta build)</li>
    <li>Sessions (the number of times you have used a beta build)</li>
    <li>Crashes (the number of crashes per beta build)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, users have the option to voluntarily send feedback or crash reports to Apple, which is then shared with the developer. This data is stored for up to one year. The following data may be collected when sending feedback or a crash report:</p>

<p>App name, app version, installed app version, device, iOS Version, macOS Version, system language, carrier, time zone, device architecture, connection type, paired Apple Watches, screenshots, comments, app uptime, free disk space, battery level, screen resolution, crash logs</p>
